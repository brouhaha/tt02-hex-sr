  top_module:  "hex_sr"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "hex shift register"      # Project title
  description:  "six 40-bit shift registers"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Six 40-bit shift registers. A multiplexer selects input data or recirulating output data."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "on each clock n, six bits are shifted in, and the six bits that were input at clock n-4 are output"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
